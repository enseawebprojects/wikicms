A wiki-enabled Content Management System


## Objective

The goal of this project is to implement a content management system, that is, a website that host articles, discussions and media
and allow users to modify this content online through an integrated editor. 

The system must provide :
* An interface to display and organize articles
* An edition interface to allow users to modify content and save their modifications
* Functionalities to assign resources, comments and discussions to a particular article
* An history where each modification is logged and can be reverted

## Authors: Eric TAN, Lionel ANDRIEU and MichaÃ«l BINACCHI.
